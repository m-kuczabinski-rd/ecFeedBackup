# Define the template that will be used to create export file
# organize the file in three sections, like below. Note that individual sections
# may be skipped and do not need to be in a particular order. Also, section headers
# are not case sensitive, so you can use [HEADER] as well as [HeAdEr]  
  [Header]
# This section will define the content that will be created in the
# export file above all the exported test data.
# Typically it contains some information about the content, like test parameters name
# test method name etc. You can use following expressions in this section:
# %package - the name of the package that the class containing test method to which the
#            test cases belong,
# %class - short name of the test class containing test method, 
# %method - name of the method containing exported test cases,
# $N.name - name of the Nth parameter (counting from 1) in the test method,
#
  [TestCase]
# This section contains a template that will be used to export data of each
# individual test case. You can use all the expressions that could be used for
# [Header] section, plus additionally:
# $N.choice - short name of the choice that will be used in the test case as Nth parameter
# $N.full_choice - qualified name of the choice used in the test case as Nth parameter, 
#                  containing all of it's parent choices in the hierarchy.
# $N.value - value of the Nth parameter of this test case
# %suite - test suite name of the test case.
# %index - a number under which this test case was exported (starting from 0). This number 
#          does not refer to any property of the test case in the model, but can be useful.
#
  [Footer]
# The bottom of the exported file. The same expressions as for header can be used here.
#
#
#
# An example template for exporting test data of a method testMethod(int year, String Manufacturer, String model):
# [Header]
# $1.name, $2.name, $3.name
# [TestCase]
# $1.value, $2.value, $3.value
# [Footer]
# #May stay empty - no footer is used for typical csv file
#
